# Python Async Comprehension

This project is part of the Holberton School Web Back-End curriculum.

## 📚 Description

This project focuses on asynchronous generators in Python using:

- `async def` functions
- `await` and `async for`
- Generating values asynchronously
- Random number generation
- Async I/O with `asyncio.sleep`

The goal is to practice writing asynchronous generators and iterating over them concurrently.
